# Problem Statement:
According to data from Census 2011, the number of child laborers in India is 10.1 million of which 5.6 million are boys and 4.5 million are girls.

3 out of Every 7 Children face some form of abuse during their childhood.

Many orphans are taken hostages as child labors, No resources or system to fight or rescue and rehabilitate them.

NGOs do not have a centralized system that can help interact with multiple parties to rescue and rehabilitate children who are victims of multiple atrocities.

# APPROACH:
Design a software system for NGOs that can initiate a restoration process for a child who has been a victim of atrocities through reporting to NGO.

A Volunteer from NGO would be assigned to the case, he would then examine the case and redirect the case to the necessary stakeholder.

Children who faced physical abuse would be sent to doctors, mental abuse would be sent to counsellor or psychiatrist depending on their state of need. Incase of any unlawful situation, the case can be sent to a lawyer.
After his treatment , the child would be sent to a rehabilitation home where his safety would be safeguarded.
